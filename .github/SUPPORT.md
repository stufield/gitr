# Getting help with gitr

Thanks for using gitr!

Before filing an issue, there are a few places to explore
and pieces to put together to make the process as smooth as possible.

## Make a reprex

If I can’t reproduce the bug, I can’t fix it!
Start by making a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the  [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. 
If you haven't heard of or used `reprex` before, you're in for a treat! 
Seriously, `reprex` will make all of your R-question-asking endeavors easier
(which is an excellent ROI for the five to ten minutes it'll take you to learn what it's all about). 
For additional `reprex` pointers, check out the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/).

## Where to ask?

Armed with your `reprex`, the next step is to figure out where to ask:

* If it's a question: start with [community.rstudio.com](https://community.rstudio.com/)
  and/or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). There are more people there to answer questions.  

* If it's a bug: you're in the right place -> [file an issue](https://github.com/stufield/gitr/issues/new).
  
* If you're not sure: let the community help you figure it out! 
  If your problem _is_ a bug or a feature request, you can easily return here and report it. 

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/stufield/gitr/issues/)
to make sure the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version. 
By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. 
You can [edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/),
`is:pr`, `is:closed`, etc., as needed, e.g. you'd simply remove `is:open` to
search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.
