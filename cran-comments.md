# This is a re re-release to CRAN

* version: `v0.0.2` -> `v0.1.0`

* there was a single (poorly written)
  unit test that was failing in `v0.0.2`
  which has now been fixed, and is the
  reason for this re-re-release

* in addition, this submission involves a
  major renaming of functions that should
  be captured in a versioned release.
  As such, resubmitting to CRAN so
  users will have access to a frozen
  version of `v0.1.0` while still being
  able to access `v0.0.2`.

* since there are mostly API (naming), unit test,
  and internal changes, I do not a
  anticipate major concerns from CRAN
  regarding package structural requirements.
