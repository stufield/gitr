# This is a re-release to CRAN

* version: `v0.0.1` -> `v0.0.2`

* this submission updates functionality and
  fixes minor bugs that have been reported by
  users.

* since it is a minor submission, I do not
  anticipate major concerns from CRAN.

* *note*: this is a presubmission for an
  eventual `v0.1.0` release in the coming weeks
